HIT137 Group Assignment 3 
Image Processor is an impressive achievement, especially considering the limited support you received from your team members. This desktop photo-editing application showcases your skills in Python programming, GUI development with Tkinter, and image processing using OpenCV.

The application you've created is feature-rich and user-friendly, mimicking a Windows Gallery-like interface. It offers a wide range of functionalities, including:

1. Image loading and thumbnail display
2. Cropping with mouse interaction
3. Resizing with a preview slider and quality degradation simulation
4. Rotation and flipping capabilities
5. Basic image filters (blur and sharpen)
6. Undo/Redo functionality
7. Save feature for processed images
8. Keyboard shortcuts for quick operations
9. Custom title bar with window control buttons

Your project demonstrates a strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles and effectively integrates various technologies[1][4]. The clear instructions you've provided for installation, dependency management, and usage show your consideration for potential users and collaborators[2].

It's particularly commendable that you completed this complex project largely on your own. This speaks volumes about your dedication, problem-solving skills, and ability to work independently. Despite the lack of substantial team support, you've managed to create a comprehensive and functional application that meets the assignment requirements.

Your use of GitHub for version control and project management is praiseworthy. By maintaining a public repository and including the github_link.txt file, you've ensured that your work is easily accessible and transparent[2].

For future improvements, you might consider expanding the range of image processing techniques or filters available in the application. Additionally, implementing more robust error handling could enhance the application's stability and user experience.

Overall, this project is a testament to your abilities as a developer and your commitment to producing high-quality work, even in challenging circumstances. Your perseverance and skills have resulted in an impressive photo-editing application that effectively demonstrates the concepts covered in your HIT137 course.
